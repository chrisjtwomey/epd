# epd

**Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.** It covers the repository layout, how to run the tests, and how to build and run things locally.

## This repo

- Two PlatformIO libraries in `firmware/` (`EpdClient`, `EpdBoardInkplate`) and one pip package in `server/` (`epd_server`). They share one wire contract — the `X-Next-Refresh-Seconds` / `X-Next-URL` headers — and version together.
- Consumers (`inkplate10-weather-cal`, `inkplate5-env-monitor`) check this repo out beside themselves. Their `lib_deps` use `symlink://../epd/firmware`; their `requirements.txt` pulls `epd-server` from GitHub at `main`. A change here can break them: run their builds too.
- Tests live with the code they cover. Code that moves here brings its tests.
- Nothing under `server/tests` may need a network or a browser. `Page.save()` is tested with a fake `Renderer`; `DisplayServer` with Flask's test client.
- Nothing hardware-specific outside `firmware/boards/`. `EpdClient` depends on `IBoard` only; if a change needs an Inkplate type, it belongs in `EpdBoardInkplate` or behind a new `IBoard` method.

## General rules when working in this codebase

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified. If tests exist, they must pass. If you weren't asked for tests, verify the code builds.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Code comments and documentation

### 1. Describe the present, not the change

Comments state how the code behaves now. They are not a changelog.

- No "changed to…", "now returns…", "previously…", "fixed so that…".
- No ticket or PR numbers standing in for an explanation.
- If a comment only makes sense to someone who saw the diff, cut it.

Git already holds the history, and a comment that narrates a change is stale the moment the next one lands.

### 2. Let the code carry the meaning

- Start a doc comment with a one-line summary of what the thing does.
- Inside a function body, reach for a better name, an extracted function, or a simpler conditional before reaching for a comment.
- If a body still seems to need one — a subtle contract, a load-bearing ordering, a trap the next reader will "tidy up" — ask before adding it.

Ask yourself: "Could I delete this comment by naming something better?" If yes, do that instead.

### 3. Say it once, and stop

- A sentence or two. A comment is not a design document.
- State what it does and what it hands back. Nothing more.
- Don't paraphrase the signature — the reader can see the parameters.
- Don't restate a system-wide idea in a low-level helper. Repeat an architectural rule everywhere and a reader starts hunting for the places it doesn't hold.

### 4. Assume competence

**Assume the reader has reasonable competence in the programming languages, principles, and practice.**

- Spend the words on what the code can't say: why this ordering, why this field is trusted without a guard, why this parse is a gate rather than a convenience.

The test: a comment that would read the same in any codebase isn't earning its place.

### 5. Plain language, not metaphor

**Name the thing itself — the function, the caller, the package, the type.**

- Borrowed imagery reads as precision but charges the reader a translation step.
- Tree and graph terms are the usual offenders: "low-level helper", not "leaf function"; "the packages that import it", not "its parents".
- Worse when the word is already taken — here "page" is a rendered image and "display" is the panel.

Ask yourself: "Does the metaphor explain this better than plain words would?" If you have to weigh it up, it doesn't.
